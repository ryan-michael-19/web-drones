## Welcome!

Web Drones is a game about exploring the world with drones to create more drones. Web drones are controled via a REST api, allowing players to learn how to make HTTP requests and write code while playing the game.

I am not currently hosting the game, but it can be ran in containers with the attached `docker-compose.yaml`.

API documentation coming soon!
